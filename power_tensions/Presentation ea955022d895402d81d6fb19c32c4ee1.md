# Power and tensions in organizations

---

# What is an organization?

---

An organization is a relation between two or more agents (human or non-human) that increase  their ability to act in the world beyond what it would be possible for each of them individually.

# Organizations and their tensions

---

## Organizations are alive

The most important thing about organizations is that, though they are tools, each nevertheless has a life of its own. [Philip Selznick](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Philip_Selznick) (1949).

---

## Professionalization

When enough resources are available and the organization needs to grow, more people are hired to handle the complexity that necessarily emerges and new practices are put in place. The original problem the organization wanted to solve is now addressed through different modes of work. 

---

## Bureaucratization

The tendency of bureaucratization can arise when direction and management is increasingly controlled by elected or appointed full-time officials.

While full-time officials *can* power-horde or introduce unnecessary mechanisms of control, they can also be sources of innovation and prevent teams and individuals to fall into complacency, and can ensure organizational stability and duration beyond individuals.

---

## Individualization

This tendency develops (often in tandem with bureaucratization) when emphasis is placed on individualistic incentives to join, stable career patterns for functionaries develop, and control over collective communication is restricted.

---

## Corruption

This tendency develops when workers' organization is being used by individuals within the  bureaucracy for personal ends like bribes or securing positions for personal friends and family members.

---

## Horizontalization

This tendency develops when workers or members grow  and enforce bottom-up feedback structures that allows them to retain or expand their control over resource allocation. Simply put, decision-making capacities are spread downwards and outwards.

---

## Horizontalism

This tendency develops when reciprocity becomes more important than efficiency. The impact becomes less relevant than the process and the guarantee or illusion of horizontality becomes more important than the original mission.

---

## Economism

This tendency develops when an organization focus exclusively and narrowly on the consumptive power of earning-generation, failing to pursue their original mission.

---

## Organization as pharmakon

None of these tendencies are necessarily evil: they emerged out of real concerns and needs. However, taken too far, everything becomes a problem. We need to achieve balance.

Organization is both remedy and poison, enabling condition and danger.

The key indicator is the lack of reciprocity: one side has a much greater capacity to put constrains on the other, to limit its field of possible actions. However, too much reciprocity leads to impotency, as those too concerned with who has the right to act take no action.

## EXERCISE: DIAGNOSING ORGANIZATIONAL TENSIONS

What kind of tensions can you identify in your organization? Which are being addressed and which are not? Can you provide examples and symptoms of such tensions? How would you address them?

# THE ECOLOGY OF POLITICAL POWER

---

## Potestas vs Potentia

**Potestas:** inertial ****power of the status quo.  It keeps things the same.

**Potentia:** trasformative power. It creates impact and change.

---

## Potestas (power-over)

1. Regards which force has the capacity to define
what get done.
2. Regards which force has the capacity to define how
things are done.
3. Regards which force has the capacity to define why
things are done.
4. Regards which force has the capacity to allocate
resources to ensure things get done.

---

## Potentia (power-to)

1. Regards the capacity to take action.
2. Regards the capacity to affect and to be affected.
3. Regards the capacity to alter Potestas

---

## Associative Power

- Built through the ability to bring people into association within and between organizations.
- Relationship building.
- Associative power depends on the capacity to pool and combine energy, skills, and resources.

---

## Mobilization Power

- Built through the ability to bring people to collectively act together, in a unified and coordinated manner. Mobilization power depends, minimally, on developing or using previously developed channels of communication.
- Its degree of coordination depends on strength of the organizational structures through which collective action is mobilized.

---

## Systemic Disruption Power

- Built through the ability to withdraw systemic cooperation in ways that create systemic disruption.
- Depends on developing enough association and mobilization power at particular points in systems.
- Kinds of actions relate to strikes, blockades, boycotts, or governmental obstruction.
- Success often depends on ability to mobilize despite incredible pressure or popular support.

---

## Operational Power

- Built through building power over the means and ends of (re)productive
structures and the processes they produce or maintain.
- Not just what is made, but how it is made.

---

## Decision-Making Power

- Built through building and/or inserting allies in key decision-making roles
within and across workplaces, institutions, or governmental systems.
- Decision-maker is someone that has power-over a resource, mechanism, process, or systemic function that can assist an initiative.

---

## Legal Power

- Built through developing laws and legal bodies that defend rights and interests and pressure capital through state mechanisms.
- State may be called upon to enforce laws and protect people' rights or interests
- Potentially frees available resources, potentially draws too much focus (legalism)

---

## Reproductive Power

- Built by systematically building (counter)institutions that maintain
individual and collective lives of people, autonomously from capital.
- This can come in the form of providing spaces; developing funds; forming media structures; education, housing and medical structures; farm systems – whatever resources reproduce the lives of workers and are in their control.

---

## Knowledge Power

- Built through the ability to generate, retain, and circulate knowledge of resistance.
- This kind of knowledge pertains to Analytical knowledge: how exploitation, oppression, and domination function, and how processes and systems function and interrelate
- Combat-organizational knowledge: knowing of practices and structures that allow people to organizes in resilient, rewarding, and politically effective ways.

---

## Discursive Power

- Built through the ability to shift, circulate, and maintain discursive frames through which people make meaning and understand issues and the problems from which they stem.
- Structures through which frames circulate occur at the grassroots and media levels, such as newspapers, websites, social media, television, and cultural productions. The latter is difficult to penetrate due to editorial processes (be it individual or algorithmic).

---

## (Counter-) Cultural Power

- Built through the capacity to shape common sense towards logics of solidarity and mutual aid, rather than competition and domination.
- Typically begins at the level of specific organizations or across social networks, but must become the dominant logic of (re)productive functions of society if it is to be the dominant value of society.
- The more decision-making, reproductive, legal, and operational power is developed, the easier it is to do so.

## Exercise: power in our ecosystem

What power does your organization have? What power do organizations and institutions around yours have? Which forms of power in your organization depend on other organizations?

---

### Exercise: what power do we need?

What power are you missing? What are you unable to do due to a lack of power? How do can you build the power you need?
